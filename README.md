# Movie-Recommendation-System
The Movie Recommendation System is a content-based recommendation engine built using Python and Streamlit. It allows users to select a movie from a list and get recommendations for similar movies along with their posters.  This system helps users discover movies they might enjoy based on their past preferences â€” similar in genre, theme, or content.
